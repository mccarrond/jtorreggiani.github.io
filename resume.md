#PROJECTS

**Empirical** -- [www.empiricalreview.com](http://www.empiricalreview.com/)

An alternative news and media provider. It is still in its very early phases, hence the construction page, but 
we are making a lot of progress! 

**Calculus with JavaScript** - [github.com/jtorreggiani/calculus_with_javascript](https://github.com/jtorreggiani/calculus_with_javascript)

A very basic attempt to do symbolic math in javascript.

**Job Search Bot**

An idea for a bot that automates my job search. Currently the project is just a collection of scripts that pull
search results from several websites including Indeed.com, WeWorkRemotely.com, and Craigslist. I have also started
experimenting with the [mechanize]() gem to click buttons on Craiglist to access additional information. 

**Compiler Interpreter** - Computer Science 1  

Took initiative to talk to the professor about doing work beyond the scope of the class. I successfully extended 
the professor's Java-based compiler, despite having no prior knowledge of the language. I was also able to
adapt the compiler's tokenizer, symbol table, and parser to build a pure interpreter. 

**Chemical Reaction Solver** - Computer Programming for Engineers (C++)  

Pursued an advanced final project despite the professor's concern about the scope of the project. Determined a 
general system of equations for balancing basic chemical equations. Independently studied linear algebra to 
develop an algorithm to solve the problem. Verified my approach with the chair of the mathematics department.
